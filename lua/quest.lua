Are you suggesting that we can use it to return underground?"},{"Alisaie","And even if that were possible, would it not simply bear us back to those places which we have already explored?"},{"Urianger","It need not, my lady. Pray allow me to explain. Upon the evidence of your experience, it seemeth plain that two internment hulks may share the selfsame aetherial egress. From this, we did infer that others may be connected in like wise. Thus did we labor long to verify the existence of further tributaries to the selfsame streamin which task we were at length successful. 'Twas then but a matter of arriving at a solution to the problem of traveling to an unattuned destination..."},{"Urianger","That one might reach what we may call the headwater, we propose to employ a modified aetheryte which serveth to amplify such ripples as do originate from said source.

Nay, my lady. As you have correctly surmised...I was not alone in this endeavor."},{"Alisaie","...Meaning there are others who are aware of our mission."},{"Alisaie","Well, it cannot be helped now.

That is why we came here, unless you have forgotten!"},{"Alphinaud","Gods forbid I should ever forget, Alisaie. But you misunderstand. I do not question your resolve, only whence it came. If it were your own, you would be able to tell me precisely why you desire so fervently to protect Eorzea."},{"Alphinaud","Yet you cannot, for it is not your resolve, but Grandfather's. You may struggle to see the difference, but borrowed resolve shall never be as strong as that which springs from within."},{"Alphinaud","...But let us speak of this another time. For now, preventing Bahamut's return is all that matters."},{"Alphinaud","To be plain, I have no objection to striking down whatever is left of Grandfather.

Yet even as this revelation explains how the heretics came to possess knowledge of the caravan routes, it raises the question of how they and the imperial agents might be connected.

Our relentless pursuit has forced him to commit a grave error."},{"Ilberd","In a desperate bid to cover his tracks, the Ivy resorted to exercising certain administrative powers available only to high-ranking members of the Immortal Flames."},{"Ilberd","If you consider then that our investigation is known to barely a handful of them, the field of suspects is greatly narrowed."},{"Alphinaud","You mean to say that the agent is among Raubahn's innermost circle? Someone who has been with him since the Immortal Flames' establishment?"},{"Ilberd","'Tis the most plausible explanation. The infiltration likely occurred during the company's founding, with the groundwork for the act being laid beforehand."},{"Alphinaud","To slip into a position of authority unremarked, and remain above suspicion all these years..."},{"Ilberd","Aye. I, too, was surprisedthough I really should not have been. Of the three Grand Companies, Ul'dah's was ever the more vulnerable to infiltration."},{"Ilberd","Both Limsa Lominsa and Gridania had long-standing armed forces that lent themselves well to the formation of the Maelstrom and the Order of the Twin Adder. To all intents and purposes, it was the same peopleloyal ones, mindunder the same leadership. Only the banner was different."},{"Ilberd","Not so the Flames. Ul'dah's military was made up of disparate orders, most of which were glorified mercenary companies that answered only to their own paymasters."},{"Ilberd","...Hardly an ideal environment in which to establish something as high-minded as a Grand Company."},{"Ilberd","The difficulties Raubahn faced when founding the Immortal Flames are well known. Even after he had convinced his fellow Syndicate members to share the cost, there remained the small matter of finding enough bodies to fill the ranks."},{"Alphinaud","Indeed.

Plainly, the threat of a resurgent Garlemald is not enough to stir them."},{"Alphinaud","And the reason for this? Deep-rooted mistrust amongst the citizenry. The nations' leaders can come to all the understandings they like, but their unity means little and less to the commonfolk."},{"Alphinaud","Take the Lominsans, for instance. Though Admiral Merlwyb outlawed piracy over a decade ago, foreigners still picture the nation as a haven for grog-swilling, wooden-legged cutthroats."},{"Alphinaud","In like wise, the Gridanians are mocked as hermits who talk to trees, and the Ul'dahns scorned as swindlers who worship coin."},{"Alphinaud","...Not that such sentiments are entirely without grounds, of course. Take that pillar of Ul'dahn society Teledji Adeledji, for example. But that is beside the point. The fact is that people are wary of outsiders whether they have cause to be or not."},{"Alphinaud","On that basis, one could argue that the conflict at Carteneau is a necessary evil."},{"Alphinaud","Each nation has its own warmongering faction that advocates the acquisition of Omega. In order to placate them, we present them something resembling warfare, and thereby curb their appetite for full-scale conflict."},{"Alphinaud","...But enough idle musing.

Return and speak with Dour Meadow.","The Mythril Cup melee commences! With the other combatants distracted in the heat of battle, Ultros attempts to employ the gold truffles he purchased from Syntgoht to elicit a mighty sneeze from his friend Typhonthe power behind Avila's so-called Tempest Blade. However, the purple fiend only succeeds in getting the fungi roasted to savory perfection by the unwitting Hildibrand. Inspector Briardien swiftly observes the Ala Mhigan gladiatrix's suspicious movements, shortly thereafter revealing Typhon and the conspirators' scheme for all to see. Ultros squirms out of responsibility by assigning all the blame to Avila, successfully convincing Dour Meadow to hold a final event among those who still remain standing in the wake of the storm. Speak with Briardien before departing for the climactic confrontation.","Less than impressed at the octopus's machinations, Briardien expresses his confidence in your ability to make some sense out of this madness.

Hildibrand confronts him, only to find his path obstructed by a spear cast by Gilgamesh, who has returned to avenge the defeat he suffered at your hands. Hildibrand moves quickly, deftly disarming his erstwhile traveling companion. As the hulking duelist angrily chases the inspector about the Coliseum, the phantom thief takes advantage of the chaos, dropping from the rafters a single gold truffle. Its aroma tickles the sensitive nose of Typhon, the resulting sneeze sending the ring soaring through the air. Just as Hildibrand has given up hope, Godbert returns, seizing his son by the legs and hurling him heavenswardand clear through the Coliseum roofwith truly Mandervillian strength. Events take another turn when the victor's ring is revealed as a fake, and the thief produces a common key and declares his intentions to claim the true treasurethe Ring of Inquiry, sat safely in the storehouse as a consolation prize. Upon hearing this, Dour Meadow panics and calls for the Stone Torches to pursue, but it is for naught, as the fiend absconds with the priceless relic. As Inspector Briardien and Ellie ponder what has transpired, a massive challenge card falls from above, and another mighty sneezethis time from Nashusends it toppling over the unfortunate Hildibrand. The message speaks of four sacred treasures and justice served, which Godbert recognizes as a reference to an old legend from the times of the Belah'dians.

Fortunately for meand for our villagemy services were in high demand."},{"Gekkai","Have you never wondered why, Oboro? Why, when Doma was subjugated by the Empire, was our village alone spared Garlemald's wrath? It was because of my actions. I protected us where the entire nation of Doma could not."},{"Oboro","Protected!? You betrayed us all! The people of Doma trusted us!"},{"Oboro","Do you know how many Domans died that day!?

Now that wasn't in the script! How soon we forget, Oboro... I was not the traitor, no, but I did follow him. That makes me just as much a traitor, at least in their eyes."},{"Oboro","...Perhaps so. At the same time, you risked your life for what you believed in. We are not so different, you and I."},{"Karasu","The sentiment is most touching, but my answer remains no.

So I will only say again: thank you for being a friend."},{"Oboro","It is strange, ... All this time, I believed I was instructing you in the way of the shinobi, and yet now that all is done, I feel that I should be the one to call you teacher."},{"Oboro","Thanks to you, I finally achieved true clarity and presence of mind. My blade is stronger for it, and more important still, I now understand what I am truly fighting for."},{"Oboro","Body or mindby any measure, you are every bit my equal as a shinobi.

After checking a slightly disgruntled Oboro, the guildmaster asks that you both aid him in tracking the thief. Follow him to Summerford Farms, and there interview the victim, Mulfa Kelfa.","The distraught merchant tells you his sad tale of how two thieves stole his one rare and oh-so-expensive Far Eastern orb. Learning that the criminals headed northwest, Jacke proposes that you immediately give chase, that you might track them down before they have a chance to escape with their ill-gotten goods. Begin by traveling to where they were last seen, just outside Summerford Farms.","You find a trail of footprints leading northwest. Follow them on the path across the bridge, towards the Descent.","The footprints continue to the northwest.

Before you come to blows, however, Mulfa Kelfa arrives. He thanks you for your service, and then asks his bodyguard to kill you. Apparently, it would not do for you to learn how he acquired the orb. Unfortunately for him, you, Jacke, and Oboro make short work of his hired blade. The strange girl grudgingly thanks you for your aid. Oboro marks her for a person from the Far East, at which point her retainer, Akagi, introduces her as Princess Yuki Yatsurugi. She left her lands in search of treasures stolen from her clan. Oboro presumptuously offers her your aid, but she refuses, calling all shinobi traitors. Akagi, however, is more accommodating to Oboro's proposal, and promises to contact you should Yuki ever be found in danger. Return now to the dock storehouse, and hear Oboro's thoughts on the matter.","Oboro tells you that the princess's skills are famed in the Far East, and that she may have little need of your help.

Deliver the post to the sultanate's preeminent information broker on Emerald Avenue, and see if the postmoogle's deduction is any good.","Wymond reads the letteronly to discover that it is a ransom note for someone named Raymond. The kidnappers, a gang known as the Purple Haze, have taken his daughter, and will do her harm unless their demands are met. Wymond bids you find the list from behind the shack at Copperbell Mines, to make up for getting him into this mess.","Deliver it to Wymond, who awaits you at his usual spot on Emerald Avenue.","Taking the list, Wymond learns that the gang is demanding the deed to a plot of Raymond's ceruleum-rich land in exchange for the girl. The information-monger detects a merchant mastermind behind the scenes, and promises to end the dastardly scheme. He reveals that he once was a member of the Purple Hazeuntil Hildibrand and a flower girl named Myrtha allowed him to escape from that life. Now, Wymond intends to trap the criminals using the markets of Ul'dah, and bids you speak with Seseroga at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange to purchase ceruleum with a banknote.","Seseroga proves most obliging after seeing the banknote, and directs you to Syntgoht for all your ceruleum needs.","The banknote allows you to strike a deal with Syntgoht. The merchant speaks of fantastic rumors that Garlond Ironworks has invented a way to make airships for a fraction of present costs, and speculates that the price of ceruleum fuel will soon soar. Return now with the ceruleum futures contract to Wymond.","Wymond reveals the rumors of cost-efficient airships have been greatly exaggeratedby him. Though the hearsay appears real enough thanks to your purchase, it was all a ploy to start a ceruleum craze. He turns next to making it appear as though the Purple Haze will betray the mastermind for a small fortune. To that end, he bids you approach a member of the gang in his haunt, the Coffer & Coffin in central Thanalan, and express your interest in ceruleum-rich land.","Over a flagon of grog, the man of the Purple Haze gives you reason to believe he would betray the merchant mastermind...for the right offer. Return with these wispy words and the futures contract to Wymond.","Handing the ceruleum futures contract back to Wymond, you learn that your meeting with the Purple Haze has reached the mastermind's ears. The merchant will reveal himself in order to confront the gang about their dealingsdrawing him into the open and right into Wymond's trap. The information-monger asks that you join him to the north of Cutter's Cry in central Thanalan, to rescue the girl and make the villains' plan go up in smoke.","From behind a bush, Wymond directs your attention to the mouth of the cave. There stand the villains, alongside Raymond's daughter. With a bit of luck, and a well-forged fake deed, you secure her release. Wymond then reveals that he sold the futures contract for the most volatile of firesandsand placed it near the scoundrels for the moment they light a pipe of somnus. One larger-than-expected explosion later, Wymond instructs the girl to return to her parents at Arrzaneth Ossuary. Verify that she makes it there safely.","Raymond is overjoyed that his daughter is little the worse for her ordeal, but even more grateful is his young wife. She thanks you profusely, and asks you deliver a small token of their thanks to Wymond as well. Deliver the single red rose to Wymond, who should be at his usual spot on Emerald Avenue.","You deliver the flower to Wymond. It is a single long-stemmed rosethe selfsame flower he once so treasured. Amazed, the information-monger opens the attached card to learn that Raymond's wife is Myrtha, the flower girl who brought him joy so long ago, and helped him towards the right side of the law.

He was a good, upstandin' type...who'd informed on the gang."},{"Wymond","Brave man's sacrifice should've made for a happy endin'. But that informer was Myrtha's brother."},{"Wymond","An' she just...vanished. Never saw her smilin' face again after that day. Not once."},{"Wymond","...Ain't easy to talk about, even after all these years."},{"Wymond","Anyroad, it was the push I needed to leave the criminal life. I sang like a canary to the most famous detective I could find: Hildibrand."},{"Wymond","But he took me for the dead man. Went around Ul'dah tellin' anyone who'd listen I was a righteous monger of information."},{"Wymond","Soon enough, all of the Haze were behind bars.

So, I stepped into the murdered bloke's life, an' rode the rumors to where I am today."},{"Wymond","Come to think on it, though, where in the hells are that Hildy an' Nashu?

Then, get a load from whomever he introduces."},{"Seseroga","Ah, adventurerwhat do you want? A purveyor of ceruleum, you say? An expensive requestdo you have the funds to back it?"},{"Seseroga","My dear how came you by such great riches?"},{"Seseroga","Your employer's money, eh?

Well, if this employer of yours is legitimate, I will be happy to assist you! And let me say, he has impeccable timing!"},{"Syntgoht","What do I mean? Why, just that the market has been full of rumors today, about Garlond Ironworks."},{"Syntgoht","The word is that those engineers found a way to craft airships for a fraction of the cost. Vessels will soon fill the skies, and the price of ceruleum will soar!"},{"Syntgoht","If this is true, ceruleum will become the most desirable of commodities. And with the amount he's willing to spend, I daresay your employer knows a thing or two we don't."},{"Syntgoht","But this is not the time for talk! Here is your ceruleum futures contract. I'll make good on itor my name isn't Syntgoht!"},{"Syntgoht","Never fear, ! I will make good on that ceruleum futures contract.

Do you have a futures contract to show for your dealin's with him?"},{"Wymond","Well, you've set the price of ceruleum soarin' high as an airship! Aye, it was me who started those rumors. But they look real now that you've placed that order."},{"Wymond","Hold on to the futures contract for now. 'Tis the very bait we need to lure the mastermind into the open."},{"Wymond","No doubt he's heard how you swept into the markets. That's like to vex him, as is the news that he's gotten himself a rival businessman with a real adept underlin'."},{"Wymond","An' how do you imagine he'd feel if said underlin' were to meet with the Haze secretly? With ceruleum prices high as they are, he'd feel betrayed for godsdamned sure!"},{"Wymond","Aye, , it's a date with a kidnapper at the Coffer & Coffin for you! You'll have to find a man of the Haze, 'course, but just keep your eyes out."},{"Wymond","Get his attention with a pint. Then, show him the futures contract, an' let it slip your employer's lookin' for rich land. His greed'll do the rest!"},{"Wymond","Plan calls for you to move yourself to the Coffer & Coffin, 'venturer, to meet a man of the Purple Haze."},{"Wymond","When you find one, put a little liquor in him. Then, give him a peek at the futures contract, an' let it slip your employer's searchin' for rich land!"},{"Villain00240","Wha...? A drink? Fine. Ain't nothin' in the realm for free, though.

S'pose it's him I ought to thank for this grog, eh?"},{"Villain00240","Mine his own ceruleum!? Har har! I'll wager he is, the greedy bugger! ...Hmmm. Maybe you've got an itch I can scratch."},{"Villain00240","I'll be comin' into the deed to a huge plot of land shortly. Ceruleum-rich land. Its yield? Take what you're imaginin', an' add two zeroes. Two."},{"Villain00240","Might be land ain't quite me cup of tea. Might be as I'm willin' to sell it. For the right offer, that is."},{"Villain00240","Just a little somethin' to think about. But I'm drownin' me troubles here most days if you fancy another chat."},{"Villain00240","The mead here don't half go down well. When you've a mind to talk business, come back an' join me for a pint."},{"Wymond","While you were gone, the price of ceruleum hit its peak. I'll need the contract back now. It'll fetch a good price, an' give me the funds to finish things with a bang."},{"Wymond","'Preciate it. Aye, an' you meetin' with that thug. Our mastermind's sure to be feelin' betrayed, what with his underlin' talkin' to my own in the Coffer & Coffin."},{"Wymond","After he went to the trouble of kidnappin' Raymond's daughter, false friends tryin' to turn a profit on their own ain't like to sit well with him."},{"Wymond","An' I've given him a little push with a certain letter as well. Reckon he'll be leavin' to question the Haze round about now."},{"Wymond","The lot of them're makin' for Cutter's Cryan' straight into the trap you've worked to bait. Leave the springin' of it to me."},{"Wymond","Heh, ain't none of them leavin' those caves unscathed."},{"Wymond","What's it I mean to do? Can't spoil the surprise yet, but don't worry unduly. Wymond's just goin' to play a tricksomethin' from the bad ol' days!"},{"Wymond","Meet me up north of Cutter's Cry, . Then, we can watch the Haze's dreams go up in smoke!"},{"Wymond","The stage is set, , an' we're in for a good show."},{"Wymond","The Haze said to put the deed over there. I obligedwith a forgery."},{"Wymond","Our mastermind's here, too. I'm hopin' my deed fools them, so they'll let the girl go."},{"Wymond","Easy, lass. You're safe now. Just keep close to that kindly 'venturer, eh?"},{"Wymond","Whew... Well, looks to be drama unfoldin' 'twixt our villains."},{"Wymond","Wouldn't want to be in that thug's bootsour mastermind's doubtless givin' the bloke a right proper grillin' about his relationship with you."},{"Wymond","But at the end of the day, the merchant needs the Haze. To keep 'em sweet, he'll offer a bigger share of the spoils."},{"Wymond","An' they'll accept it, I don't doubt. No sense in them sidin' with some 'venturer they barely know over the merchant's coin."},{"Wymond","So they'll seal their deal with the Haze's solemn custompassin' a pipe while speakin' a crook's vow: That sworn in somnus's glow holds true in hellsfire. Hah! As if a puff or two bound them to anythin'."},{"Wymond",""},{"Wymond","But I will say, that bit of somnus takes the edge off. But what if some bloke went an' hid military-grade firesand nearby? Heh heh."},{"Wymond","Aye, the moment they light their pipe, one hundred million gil's worth of the stuff will explode! That's what I sold the futures contract for: explosives what can blow a settlement sky-high!"},{"Wymond","Least, that's what the fellow who sold itEr...now hold on a moment..."},{"Wymond","That whole sky-high bit might not've been a figure of speech..."},{"Wymond","Seven hells!I...er, hope somethin' survived that..."},{"Wymond","Well, little one, I reckon you've had enough excitement to last a lifetime.

Accordingly, he asks that you question others around the Ossuary in the hope of gaining further insight into the prelate's recent behavior.","Talk around the Ossuary suggests that Yayake, dearest disciple of the disgraced guildmaster, has been visiting Mumuepo at the Coliseum. She may even have taken several important thaumaturgical texts to him from the guild's private collection. Report this incriminating hearsay back to Cocobuki.","The ominous news that Yayake has removed several volumes from the guild's library leaves Cocobuki profoundly perturbed. Only by determining which titles the prelate has purloined can he hope to uncover the conspirators' schemes. To this end, he entrusts you with the inventory of the guild's library, and urges you to scour the bookshelves that line the Ossuary walls to verify which texts were taken.","You have completed your search, and identified the missing volumes. Return to the guildmaster to report your findings.","The list of missing manuscripts appears to confirm Cocobuki's worst fears. Every title bore special significance to Master Mumuepo, and the fact that the copies taken lack the extravagant ornamentation that became his obsession would seem to imply that they hold some practical value to him. But what could he be plotting? In desperation, Cocobuki decides to set a trap for Yayake in a bid to make her talk. He would have you conceal yourself before the rear entrance to the Coliseum, and ambush the parlous prelate as she steals away to meet her conspirator-in-chief.","Yayake confesses all. Racked with guilt over her inability to prevent her master's fall from grace, she has been secretly working towards his rehabilitation, and preventing others from following in his footsteps. Cocobuki accepts the sincerity of the prelate's words, and encourages her to put her expiatory intentions to work in service to the guild.

So I have taken a stand. Any aspiring initiate who I adjudge to lack the necessary aptitude, I turn away."},{"Yayake","If that goes beyond a prelate's prerogative, so be it. Too often have I seen the spark of enthusiasm in a novice's eye turn into the conflagration that consumes him.

Might he be working through Yayake to deprive the guild of new blood, and thereby precipitate our eventual downfall?"},{"Cocobuki","If so, it has been for naught.

She always has her head in a book. A habit she picked up from Master Mumuepo, I believe."},{"Mamane","In the study of esoteric tomes, he was without equal. So skilled was he at extracting knowledge from the most cryptic texts that he was even able to bring several long-forgotten magicks back to life."},{"Mamane","Such achievements prompted many to look past his more questionableactivitiesYayake among them. Others, however, were not so forgiving. The truth is, long before his fall from grace, there were more than a few in the guild who regarded him with suspicion."},{"Mamane","Not Yayake, though. She has always been such an earnest, single-minded person, completely devoted to deepening her understanding of thaumaturgy. She saw only her master's genius..."},{"Mamane","Poor woman... She did so adore him. It must have come as quite a shock when his many failings were aired so publicly. I would not be surprised if she shared his humiliation. But she didn't let it affect her workif anything, it only made her more determined than before."},{"Mamane","Although, it's strange...

There is but one thing to tell: she breaks her fast on thaumaturgical texts, and sups on treatises."},{"Yayaroku","...Mayhap literally, if the guild librarians are to be believed. According to them, she has taken several weighty volumes from the Ossuary, and has thus far failed to return a single one. Just what could she be doing with them?"},{"Yayaroku","Yayake has always had a voracious appetite for learning, and few are more familiar than her with the guild's collection. The volumes that line these walls are some of the most fundamental scriptures of the thaumaturgical canon."},{"Yayaroku","I can scarce believe that a woman of her learning would remove such manuscripts from the collection.

It seems Yayake was more deeply in thrall to our predecessor than I first assumed. And the business of these missing tomes does not bode well."},{"Cocobuki","Mumuepo was renowned for his almost preternatural ability to piece together scraps of arcane knowledge from the most moth-eaten manuscripts, and bring long-lost sorceries back to life."},{"Cocobuki","If, as seems likely, Yayake delivered the stolen tomes to him, he may at this very moment be endeavoring to reawaken some dread magick with which to exact vengeance against the sultanate..."},{"Cocobuki","But without knowing which texts have been taken, we can only guess at his intentions... Hold on a moment! You did say the books had been removed from the guild's private collection, did you not?"},{"Cocobuki","Thal be praisedthere may yet be a way! Here, take this. It is the full inventory of the guild's archives, listing every manuscript that lines these walls. Simply compare the books on the shelves against the titles on this list, and our missing texts shall be revealed!"},{"Cocobuki","The guild has collected many thousands of tomes over the centuriesto take stock of them all would require no small amount of time, not to mention patience. Were I you, I should begin by looking out for any conspicuous gaps in the shelves..."},{"System","A copy of Thaumaturgy: The Yawning Abyss appears to be missing."},{"System","A copy of The Cry from the Depths appears to be missing."},{"System","A copy of The Lesser Key of Thal appears to be missing."},{"System","A copy of The Troth of Kings appears to be missing."},{"Cocobuki","Is it done? Quickly, thenshow me which titles are missing."},{"Cocobuki","Hmm... It is as I feared. All of the missing volumes are works which held a special fascination for our former guildmaster. It is all but certain that he requested them."},{"Cocobuki","Alas, I cannot speak for their content. What I can say, is that Mumuepo will not have chosen them on a whim. Being a connoisseur of ancient manuscripts, he knows the worth of every volume here. The illuminative worth, I should addthough he knows the pecuniary worth just as well."},{"Cocobuki","As you may have heard, he became obsessed with collecting lavishly ornamented codices, frittering our funds away on gilded or bejeweled copies of works already in our possession. He would even buy works of little scholarly value, providing they were rare enough to drive up the price."},{"Cocobuki","By the end, the walls of his study were awash with gold and gems, and he would stare at them for hours, rapt in silent adoration. In his lust for luster, he emptied first the guild's coffers, then his own, being driven at last to the felonious peculation that would prove his undoing."},{"Cocobuki","I mention this because the volumes which Yayake took were wholly without ornamentmeaning that Mumuepo desired them for their content and not their form. I fear something terrible lurks in those pages, something which Mumuepo alone may be capable of discovering... There is nothing for itthe prelate must be made to talk."},{"Cocobuki","The end of Yayake's shift draws near. I propose we lay a trap for her. Lie in wait outside the rear entrance to the Coliseum. I will stalk her from the shadows, and when we have her cornered...we close the net!"},{"Cocobuki","Hurry, to the Coliseum! Our only hope of exposing the truth of this murky intrigue is to catch Yayake in the act."},{"Cocobuki","Hm hm hm... Heading back to the guild so soon, Prelate?"},{"Yayake","Wha!? Master Co... Coco... Cocobo...?"},{"Cocobuki","Cocobuki. Prelate Yayake, you stand accused of treason. The Brass Blades have passed certain information to me which suggests that you have been conspiring with Mumuepo to incite rebellion against the crown."},{"Cocobuki","I have been conducting an investigation to establish the veracity of their report.  here has been assisting me in my inquiries."},{"Yayake","...Treason? No. I will admit that I have sought to meet with Master Mumuepo, but he has yet to agree to speak with me."},{"Cocobuki","And what of the manuscripts you took from the guild? Do you claim that you removed them not at your former master's behest, but upon your own initiative?"},{"Yayake","I do...though I know it was wrong. I...I thought that if I could show him some of the texts he used to love so much, it might help to rekindle the passion he once felt for his studies..."},{"Yayake","By the time I realized how low he had sunk through his lust for gold, it was too late. If I had only paid more attention... If I hadn't been so absorbed in my own studies... I owe it to him to help him in whatever way I can!"},{"Cocobuki","...This weight has been on your heart for a long time."},{"Yayake","I failed my master in his hour of need, but I have been attempting to make amends for it ever since. I have neglected my own advancement, and devoted myself to investigating what caused Master Mumuepo to stray from the path of enlightenment."},{"Yayake","In secret, I began to study the careers of every new initiate, hoping to identify such corruptive factors. In so doing, I feel I have gained an instinctive sense of which aspirants will bring honor to our noble art, and which stand at risk of being lost to the void."},{"Cocobuki","And so you began to turn away those applicants whom you deemed unsound, hoping to prevent future thaumaturges from following your former master down the path to self-destruction..."},{"Yayake","That was mine intent, yes. Yet search as I might, I have been unable to find any precedent for my supposed predictive instinct in the ancient texts. Mayhap I have been deceiving myself, along with everyone else..."},{"Cocobuki","The texts contain the accumulated knowledge of those who have gone before us. They do not preclude us from adding our own. The map of the void is ever incompleteit is our duty to delve into its unknown reaches, and bring back new insight for the guidance of future generations."},{"Cocobuki","The ability to divine a man's nature at a glance would make a valuable addition to a thaumaturge's arsenal. It warrants investigation. Can I rely on you to research this matter further? Should you find evidence to support your claims, I will of course require that you systematize the process."},{"Cocobuki","This shall be your atonement, Yayake, and a fresh opportunity to resume your studies. Though the mistakes of the past cannot be undone, mayhap through this the mistakes of the future can yet be prevented."},{"Yayake","Thank you, Master! If it can be of any assistance to the guild, I shall devote myself to this research with all my heart!"},{"Cocobuki","I thank you, , for helping to bring the truth of this matter to light. Rest assured that I shall instruct the Brass Blades that their suspicions regarding Prelate Yayake are completely unfounded."},{"Cocobuki","But for now, let us return to the Ossuary.

The collector speculates that Jijiroon may have gone north to buy protection from the Mamool Ja, but is unwilling to follow the trader into beastman territory without a significant increase to his fee.

Even as the guildmaster heaps praise upon you, a puller arrives with alarming news that the ordinarily fertile Rhotano Sea has ceased to yield its bounty.

The scholar arrives with news that the fisheries along the Rhotano seaboard face extinction unless the Nepto Dragon is removed from circulation. Like many monsters, it currently resides in Costa del Sol. Go there and speak with the steersman.","You come to a quick understanding with the steersman. His boat will take you to the Rhotano privateer, where your destiny awaits in the form of a giant fish. If you should catch this Nepto Dragon, the saltworn captain is keen to take a measure of the fish...and you.","You have killed a legend to save the local economy; such is the trade-off in these calamitous times. Your erstwhile opponent now lies limply on deck, awaiting Ascelyn's delicate knives. It occurs to you that Wawalago may share your sense of loss, and so seek him out him you shall.","Wawalago's sense of loss has less to do with mystique and more to do with meunire.

We must cast about elsewhere for the cause of the collapsing catch."},{"Ascelyn","Ah, ahem. I am happy to report that I have solved the mystery of the plummeting fish population. That is to say, the fishery in the Rhotano Sea is doomed thanks to the Nepto Dragon."},{"Wawalago","The absent Ascelyn arrives! Your academic acumen is always appreciated! So there be dragons in these deeps?"},{"Ascelyn","Ahem, Master Wawalago, you did say that the Calamity displaced fauna from their natural habitats. Well, not in so many words, but I believe we understand one another."},{"Ascelyn","I have verified that indeed, sightings of the Old Ones soared following the Calamity. More importantly, I have discovered that the Nepto Dragon is calamity's mistress."},{"Ascelyn","That is to say, the creature always appears just after a natural disaster."},{"Ascelyn","Historical records also spoke of slumping fish stock at the time of the Nepto Dragon's appearance."},{"Ascelyn","So, ah, this current situation in the Rhotano Sea looks to be history repeating itselfthat is to say, the fisheries here will die a painful, lingering death."},{"Ascelyn","And as for what this creature is, ah, I believe I know that alsoa sport born of little Thalaos!

And, ah, congratulations on avoiding the destruction of an entire way of life and all that. If you'll excuse me, I must get to the laboratory."},{"Ascelyn","Hm? Oh, yes, the fish stock should return to normal. Stands to reason that if nothing's eating them, they wouldn't be dead."},{"Sisipu","Then it's time we return to Fisherman's Bottom and deliver the good news to everyone!"},{"Wawalago","Mmm... The lucent length of the late living legend fills me with fancies of flaky flesh! Surely science is not so stingy that it can't spare a succulent slice?"},{"Sisipu","You want to eat the Nepto Dragon? That is so... Wawalago, it's science. Ascelyn's research is far more important than your supper plans!"},{"Sisipu","Oh, Wawalago will be fine.

Patience is precious, though precious few perceive it so."},{"Wawalago","Philosophical followings are not my forte! But few can beat me in braising, boiling, and browbeating! Ascelyn sneaked me some scrumptious steaks sawed off the Nepto Dragon!"},{"Wawalago","No speaking to Sisipu of thisshe's blinded by science! Now, decisions, decisions! Browned in butter? Capers?
